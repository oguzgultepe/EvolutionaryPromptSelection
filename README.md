# Evolutionary Prompt Selection
## Automated prompt generation for the Planner/Worker/Solver (PWS) framework via evolutionary selection.
This repository implements an evolutionary selection method to find the most instructive examples for solving novel tasks with the PWS framework.
The repository also includes a simplified implementation of the PWS framework that works with a single LLM instance.

Work in progress
